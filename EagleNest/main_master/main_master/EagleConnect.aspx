                        I found out about the Microsoft Software Engineer position through JopWell and connections I made
                        through LinkedIn. After thoroughly reading through every requirement for the full-time Software Engineer 
                        position, I knew that Microsoft was a perfect fit and Software Engineer was a phenomenal opportunity to push 
                        myself, and grow in the technology industry.

                        significantly improved my coding, teamwork, critical thinking, analytical, project management and detail-orientated skills. 
                        I also have the opportunity to work on my confidence and presentation skills by presenting prototypes and finished software 
                        to the c-suite.
